# Precipitation Analysis tools
This repository contains scripts and notebooks I made during my first research project on **precipitation systems around Bangalore**. These include tools to obtain data from NASA's TRMM mission, ERA5 reanalysis, and Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD) ground based precipitation measurements. There are tools for **vizualising** these data and an algorithm I designed to **identify and track the rainfall systems**. 

I am including the report I made during this project, which outlines the motivation and ideas behind these analysis tools.
